# code-challenge-2021

1. Make `Hello World` appear on the webpage. There is some existing code but it needs work.
2. Play the included bling sound when the user clicks on `Hello World`
3. If that was easy, then add some more visual bling to the page when the sound plays

Look in the docs folder for a screenshot of the final layout.

Implement this challenge using only javascript. You should not have to modify the html or css nor add any libraries.

Hints:

1. there are issues with the css. for some reason the words do not appear?
2. there are issues with the code. the loop is really sloppy, hhhhhm.
3. there's a sound on the page. you just need to listen for it. it's one click away.
